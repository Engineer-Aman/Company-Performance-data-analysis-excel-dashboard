I took the company performance dataset and build a dashboard for it using Excel,excel is still a widely used tool for data analysis and itâ€™s always a good tool to have under your belt.

Let me share with you how the dashboard looks:

As you can see in the picture, on the dashboard there are different charts. Graphs are there and it's very easy to visualize the data of a company on different parameters like sum of sales by category name, sum of sales by continents (continents is nothing but regions). In that we can observe that sales of products based on categories also are region by sales of company. Also we can see that profit by continent and region it shows that the profit earned by company in different regions, as profit of a company in Australian region is more and in European region it's moderate.
