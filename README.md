I took the company performance dataset and build a dashboard for it using Excel,excel is still a widely used tool for data analysis and it’s always a good tool to have under your belt.

Let me share with you how the dashboard looks:

As you can see in the picture, in dashboard there are different charts graphs are thre and it's very easy visualize the data of comany in different parameters like sum of sale by category name, sum of sale by continents (continents is nothing but regions), in it we can observe that sales of product based on catergories also region wise sales of company.Also we can see that profite by continent and region it shows that the profite earned by comapny in different regions,as profit of company in austrlian region is more and in europen region it's moderate.
