I took the company performance dataset and build a dashboard for it using Excel,excel is still a widely used tool for data analysis and it’s always a good tool to have under your belt.

Let me share with you how the dashboard looks:

As you can see in the picture, on the dashboard there are different charts. Graphs are there and it's very easy to visualize the data of a company on different 

parameters like sum of sales by category name, sum of sales by continents (continents is nothing but regions). In that we can observe that sales of products based on 

categories also are region by sales of company. Also we can see that profit by continent and region it shows that the profit earned by company in different regions, as 

profit of a company in Australian region is more and in European region it's moderate. We can see that in sum of sales by order date and category name, the sale of 

categorical product is more from 01-07-2020 to 23-06-2021 and in categories Bikes and accessories sale was more than cloths, also we can see that from 22-06-2022 sale 

was increasing. In the column chart of total sale and profits by country we can saw that total sale and profit in United States was more than other countries where there sales was more than 4.5cr and total profit was more than 2.5cr. Also we can saw that France and Germany where less sales and profit also rather than other countries like Canada and United Kingdom.
In the chart of total sales and profit by subcategory we can see that sale and profit of Tires and Tubes of vehicle was too high it’s more than 15cr, also we can saw that sale and profit of cleaners was very less. In char of customers annual Income by occupation and gender we can saw income of professional worker is more than other in it females income was little more than men.
